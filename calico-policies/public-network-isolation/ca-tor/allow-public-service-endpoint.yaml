# This policy allows outgoing network traffic from worker nodes in each zone of
# your cluster to the cluster master through the public service endpoint. Note
# that you must allow outgoing traffic for all of the zones within the region.

# NOTE: The policies in the ca-tor directory are meant for use with the Toronto multizone location.
# For the Toronto single zone location, use the policies in the us-east directory instead.
